			<h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold text-secondary">Our Mission</h2>
			<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
				The DEBT Rewards Strategy app was born out of a personal need to streamline the management of
				rewards, token values, reward rates, and NFT counts. Initially, I developed the app to
				manage my own portfolio more efficiently, eliminating the need for manual copy-pasting into
				a Google spreadsheet.
			</p>
			<p class="text-lg">
				As the app evolved, I realized its potential benefit to others in the D.E.B.T. Box project
				community. With this broader focus, I prioritized ensuring user privacy and data control by
				keeping all data locally in users' web browsers instead of a central database.

			<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
				At DEBT Rewards Strategy, we believe in the importance of privacy and giving users full control
				over their data. By storing data locally in your browser, we ensure that your information
				stays private and secure. You have complete control over your data without relying on
				external servers or databases.
			</p>
			<p class="text-lg">
				This approach not only protects your privacy but also enhances the performance and
				reliability of the app, as all data processing happens directly within your browser.
